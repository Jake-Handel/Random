      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        'Les Petit Joyeux' is ultimately, a very simple premise. Translating to
        "Little Happiness", this website compiles a selection of toys from the
        Powerhouse Museum. Our aim is give people an insight into the evolution
        of toys over the years, and bring a little touch of happiness and
        nostalgia into the everyday.
