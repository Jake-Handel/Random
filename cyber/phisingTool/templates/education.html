    <h2>🎯 This Was a Phishing Simulation!</h2>
    
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Good news!</strong> You've just participated in a security awareness training exercise. 
        The email you received was a simulated phishing email designed to help you recognize real threats.
    </div>

    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
    <p>You clicked on a link in what appeared to be a legitimate email, but was actually part of a 
    security training simulation. In a real phishing attack, this could have led to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Compromise of your login credentials</li>
        <li>Installation of malware on your device</li>
        <li>Theft of sensitive information</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access to company systems</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tips-list">
        <h3>🛡️ How to Spot Phishing Emails:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check the sender's email address</strong> - Look for misspellings or suspicious domains</li>
            <li><strong>Look for urgency</strong> - Phishing often creates false urgency ("Act now!", "Your account will be suspended")</li>
            <li><strong>Hover over links</strong> - Check if the URL matches what you expect</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for poor grammar</strong> - Many phishing emails contain spelling and grammar mistakes</li>
            <li><strong>Verify requests</strong> - If you're unsure, contact the supposed sender through official channels</li>
            <li><strong>Don't trust attachments</strong> - Be cautious with unexpected attachments</li>
        </ul>
